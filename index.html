      “Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”<br>
                 ― Rick Cook, The Wizardry Compiled
    </p></li>
    <p>
      <li>
      “The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.”<br>
― Donald E. Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science
    </p></li>
    <p>
      <li>
      “Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day.
Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.”<br>
― Muhammad Waseem.
